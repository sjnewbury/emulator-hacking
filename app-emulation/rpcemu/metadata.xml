		RPCemu (an acronym for "RiscPC" emulator) is an open-source,
		low-level Acorn RiscPC/A7000 emulator developed for Windows and
		Linux originally by Sarah Walker.

		The RiscPC was the penultimate Acorn desktop computer
		based around the ARM CPU architecture (which Sophie Wilson and
		Steve Furber invented at Acorn in 1983-1984).  It was
		compatible with processors from the ARM610 to the SA110
		StrongARM from DEC.  It was followed by the less upgradable
		entry-level 32 MHz ARM7500(FE) system-on-a-chip based A7000(+).

		There is also emulation of the RiscPC2 (codename Pheobe)
		which was terminated shortly before going to market as
		Acorn began to be asset striped before liquidation.
